# Project Structure

### PackStream

Package exists at packages/dart_packstream. See [packstream.mdc](mdc:.cursor/packstream.mdc)
For structures, look at [structure_semantics.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/structure_semantics.mdc) for example structures. These will not be implemented directly in the PackStream package, but rather in the Bolt one. The Structure implementation in the PackStream package should take in an interface that the Bolt package structures would fulfill.

### Bolt

Package exists at packages/dart_bolt.

### Neo4j Driver

Package exists at packages/dart_neo4j.

## Scripts

See [dpk.yaml](mdc:dpk.yaml) for defined scripts. Use those to run tests. Run them via `dpk run <script_name>`. For example: `dpk run test:packstream`
